### Data Structures and Algorithms

#### Singly Linked List
📖 Introduction
A Singly Linked List (SLL) is a linear data structure consisting of a sequence of nodes.
Each node stores:
- A value
- A pointer/reference to the next node
Unlike arrays, linked lists do not store elements in contiguous memory, making insertions and deletions efficient.

#### Doubly Linked List
📖 Introduction
A Doubly Linked List (DLL) is a linear data structure consisting of nodes where each node contains:
- Value
- Pointer/reference to the next node
- Pointer/reference to the previous node
- This allows traversal both forward and backward, improving flexibility compared to a singly linked list.
