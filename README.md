### Data Structures and Algorithms

#### Singly Linked List
📖 Introduction
A Singly Linked List (SLL) is a linear data structure consisting of a sequence of nodes.
Each node stores:
- A value
- A pointer/reference to the next node
Unlike arrays, linked lists do not store elements in contiguous memory, making insertions and deletions efficient.
